# Test Yourself: Answers

This is the file you'll use to add your answers to the [Test Yourself exercise](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/getting-comfortable-with-git-and-the-command-line). You will add them via pull request.

### Instructions

See the [Web Development Basics project](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/) for details.

Keep your answers under 3 paragraphs.  Replace the line that says *Your Explanation Here!* with your explanation and a link to your Github username.  See the example below.

The `.md` extension on this file means it's a markdown file.  You can just assume it's a text file with a bit of HTML-ish syntax.  If you'd like to read up more on markdown, which can be converted to HTML so you can add images or videos, check out the [documentation from Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  You shouldn't have any problem copying the styles other people have used.

### Example Answer

#### Example Question

## All About Web Developers

#### What does a Web Developer do?

A web developer's job is very hands-on, and can vary wildly from person to person. Generally, a web developer's job involves a lot of planning, building websites or web apps from the ground up, deploying them, and maintaining them by fixing bugs or optimizing the code. 

In otherwords, a web developer plays the role of both an architect and handyman, but their work lives in the cloud.

*Contributed by [Daniel Au](https://github.com/dakmau)*

#### What's the difference between web developers and web designers?

Web designers are focused on the artistic design and ux/ui of a website or web app, whereas developers are focused on how to build it, although there is some overlap between the two nowadays. 

#### What's the difference between front end, back end, and full stack developers?

Front-end developers focus more on the actual webpage itself, how the site looks to the end user. Back-end devlopers focus on the server side code that runs the applicaiton, Usually they use programming languages like Python, Ruby, or Java. Full-Stack developers are responibile for both the front-end and back-end of the application. 

Front-end developers are responsible for User Interaction. Back-end developers focus on storing, delivering, and generating data for the front end. A full-stackdeveloper does all of these things.

*Contributed by [Yilen Pan](http://github.com/yilenpan)*

#### What's the difference between static and dynamic web pages?

Dynamic webpages change depending on the user input and actions. Because of this they also require a more complicated server. Static web pages offer no dynamic changes and keep their content no matter the actions of the end-user. 

Dynamic pages allows users to create, destroy, edit, and read data. The data persists even when the page is closed, unlike static pages which are reloaded each time a browser is refreshed.

#### What's the best way to get help when you get stuck?

The best bet to get help when you are stuck is to use google! There are other fantastic resources but google will give you great access to all of them. a lot of times you will find your answer turning up on StackExchange.

*Contributed by [Nick Schwaderer](http://github.com/Schwad)*

#### Where are the closest developer communities to you?

Montana Programmers is a great statewide organization that also has a lot of smaller meetups available from meetup.com. There is a weekly Ruby lunch in Missoula, Montana and several general programmer meetups and drinkups in the region. 

*Contributed by [Nick Schwaderer](http://github.com/Schwad)*


#### What online developer communities can you join?

Start with IRC channels, subreddits, and various meetup groups in your specific area. 

Look at r/Programming or r/learnprogramming 
*Contributed by [Yilen Pan](http://github.com/yilenpan)*

#### Why is it better to use a developer-friendly text editor like Sublime Text than something oriented more towards word-processing like Microsoft Word?

Text editors like sublime are intuitive and dynamic in managing your text from a developers perspective. As a personal note the text editors are also much easier on your eyes as you are looking through code.

*Contributed by [Nick Schwaderer](http://github.com/Schwad)*


#### What are the top 3 characteristics of great web developers?

Curiosity/creativity - The passion for creating/building and the hunger for learning new technologies
Ability to think quickly and problem solve - Figuring out a soluition to a problem construct on your feet and easily is a hallmark of a great developer
Persistence - The developer world is fraught with obstacles and setbacks, but persistence will pave the way to success

#### What do companies look for in a junior web developer?

*Your explanation here!*

#### What is the hiring process like for a developer?

To apply for a job, you'll have to submit a resume, cover letter, links to your portfolio projects, and your Github page.  If the employer likes what they see, you will likely have a phone screen interview, through which the employer will get more information on your background and interest in the position (and also determine if you pass their baseline requirements).  If they bring you on-site, you will likely have a series of interviews, each with a different focus (behavior assessment, portfolio/code review, on-the-spot programming observation).  Every company's different, but this is the sort of application process I would prepare for!

## How the Web Works


#### What is the internet?

Simply put, the internet is a global system of interconnected computers and devices, all communicating with each other via a common language (or standard protocol).

*Contributed by [Daniel Au](https://github.com/dakmau)*


#### How is information broken down and sent?

It is broken down into packets and sent through random different ways to get to their destination.


#### What are packets?

Packets are bits of data that are parts of a whole that are sent from one computer or server to another. An image, video or some other asset is requested by a client and the host serves them up by breaking it down into smaller chunks called packets that are sent out with information attached to them that signifies where they are to be routed and how to piece them all back together.

*Contributed by [Dondi Fusco](https://github.com/dondi2112)*


#### What is a "client"?

A client is a device that need to get something. For example if we want to watch videos on Youtube, so we're client.

*Contributed by [Bagus Aji Santoso](https://github.com/baguzzzaji)*


#### What is a "server"?

A server is a special device that waiting for a request from the client. When the client sent their requests, server will look for it. If the server found what the client want, the server then will return the data to the client. If the server can't found what the client want, then the server will tell the client that what they want is not present on the server.

*Contributed by [Bagus Aji Santoso](https://github.com/baguzzzaji)*


#### What is HTTP and how does an HTTP request work?

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is the standard method used to request and transmit data across the internet.  When a user enters a URL in their browser, the browser generates the HTTP request and sends it to the server, which also responds via HTTP to provides the data & files for the requested site.

*Contributed by [Adam Kinson](http://github.com/kinsona)*

#### What are DNS servers?

A DNS server is a special kind of computer that links human-readable names of web sites, such as www.google.com, to their actual IP address location.

For example, instead of typing www.google.com and asking a DNS server to look-up the address of google for you, you can simply enter http://74.125.224.72/ directly into your browser!

*Contributed by [Daniel Au](https://github.com/dakmau)*

#### What is HTML and how is it used?

Hypertext markup language, a language of tags used to define the structure and
content of Web pages, such as headings, lists, paragraphs, line breaks, images,
etc.
*Contributed by [Michael Alexander](http://github.com/betweenparentheses)*

#### What is CSS and how is it used?

Cascading Stylesheets, a language that describes the look and style of the elements
defined in an HTML document, such as fonts, colors, spacing, transparency, alignment,
and other design aspects of a page. In short, it makes the raw information look pretty,
and it makes the front end simpler by separating presentation from content.
*Contributed by [Michael Alexander](http://github.*com/betweenparentheses)*

#### What is your browser's Web Inspector (aka Developer Tools) and how can you use it to poke around in a page's HTML?

Developer Tools will show you the actual HTML and CSS that generated content on the page.  By hovering over items, you can see how they were defined in HTML, how they were styled in CSS, and any other relevant attributes.  You can open up the Developer Tools by right-clicking in the browser and selecting "Inspect Element."

*Contributed by [Adam Kinson](http://github.com/kinsona)*

The Web Inspector is a tool that allows you to view a web page’s source, the DOM hierarchy, debug Javascript, and more.


#### What happens behind the scenes after you click "search" on google.com?

A single click rings out on a dark night...
Picoseconds later (a lot of them) later the input is received by a usb or other peripheral device port
Nanoseconds later (a pile of them)  a short string of integers is sent and interpreted by the CPU of device used as a "click".
Milliseconds later (a group of them) a command is sent to open up an http handshake 
Microseconds late (a few of them) the handshake is confirmed and search query data is exchanged
Centiseconds later (a handful of them) the data is processed and the return data is exchanged
Decaseconds later (two point five of them, in this case) your search is returned to your screen.

"About 98,600,000 results (0.25 seconds) https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=divisions+of+a+second”

There was a great reddit post on this somewhere that I filed away mentally. I will return it (in far more than .25 seconds) when I find it.

## The Command Line

#### What is the command line?

A terminal/shell that one opens and types in commands for various tasks (moving between directories, opening, editing files, removing files, changing settings and permissions, ,etc)

#### What is a "Superuser" and how do you execute commands as this user?

The "Superuser" is a user of a computer system with special privileges needed to administer and maintain the system. Superuser commands can be executed using 'sudo' in the command line, which stands for Superuser do.

'sudo' allows a user to run programs with the security privileges of another user, often the superuser or root user.

#### What is the `.bash_profile` file and what is it used for?

The bash '.bash_profile' file is a startup file for the bash shell and is used for many things such as declaring the $PATH variable for login shells.
*Contributed by [Jason Barkley](https://github.com/jbarkl3y)*

#### What is the `$PATH` variable?

The $PATH variable is an environmental variable in the GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems that tells _shell_ which directories to search for *executable files* in response to commands issued by a user.

$PATH dictates the locations within a file tree that contains commands executable within a command line setting

*Contributed by [Jason Barkley](https://github.com/jbarkl3y)*
*Contributed by [Dakota Maulding](http://github.com/dakota2mu)*


#### Why might you need to add onto your `$PATH` variable?

You might need to add onto your $PATH variable so an application can be found and run in the command line.
*Contributed by [Richard Peterson](https://github.com/webbuyrich)*

#### What are alias commands?

Alias commands are shortcuts that can be set up for use with the command line. These are often set for convenience so things such as long scripts that are often repeated don't need to be fully typed out.

For instance, when using Sublime Text, one may not want to always manually locate files and open them using the application. Instead, an alias can be set such as 'subl' which can be used in the command line preceding the filename. This opens the file in sublime text, voila!

i.e. 'subl text.txt'

## Terms to Know

Define the following:

### The Web


#### URL( Uniform Resource Locator)

Address that one types in to reach a particular webpage.  Human readable address that eventually gets mapped through DNS into actual IP addresses.
*Contributed by [Michelle Ho](http://github.com/michelleyho)*


#### Domain
The part of the URL which specifies the location of the web server who is going to respond to your request.
*Contributed by [Richard Peterson](https://github.com/webbuyrich)*


#### IP Address

IP addresses are the absolute address of a website. Four number ranging from 0 to 255 and separated by commas, these are unique but difficult to remember for the everday user - hence the creation of URLs and the DNS.

*Contributed by [Malcolm Reddoch](http://github.com/mreddoch)*

A specific and unique numeric signifier of a networked entity; can be an appliance, computer, phone, etc. 

*Contributed by [Dondi Fusco](https://github.com/dondi2112)*


#### DNS

The Domain Name System, or DNS, is the phone book of the Internet. It takes human-readable URLs and translates them to IP addresses so that packets know exactly where to go.

*Contributed by [Malcolm Reddoch](http://github.com/mreddoch)*


#### HTTP

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the protocol or standard used for transferring information around the web. It is the agreed upon way a browser (or client) and server "talk" through requests by the browser (or client) and responses by the server.

HyperText Transfer Protocol, defines how messages are formatted and transmitted and what actions web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands. For example a URL request to retrieve a web page from a server.

*Contributed by [Yoshio Varney](https://github.com/yoshi415)


#### HTTPS

HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure is the secure version for safe transactions, although the protocol gets a bit more complicated.


#### POP & IMAP & SMTP

POP stands for Post Office Protocol, IMAP for Internet Messaging Access Protocol,and SMTP for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. These are set of protocols for handling email.


#### API

API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a set of programming instructions and standards for accessing a Web-based software application. Software companies typically release APIs to the public so that other software developers can design products that are powered by its service.

For example, Amazon.com released its API so that web developers could more easily access Amazon's product information. Using the Amazon API, a third-party website can post direct links to Amazon products with updated prices and product descriptions. 

*Contributed by [Matt Davis](http://github.com/chewieee)*


#### Web Server

A program usually running on a remote computer that responds to requests from a browser.

*Contributed by [Unknown]*


#### Bugs

An error or defect in software or hardware that causes a program to malfunction.  Typically coding issue, but has extended to other fields.

For example: From DARPA newsletter 6.11.2009 "Code compiled successfully (completed tier 1.6 of Google/Haliburton world takeover project), but during deployment we found several bugs where sample populations were still able to think and feel independently.

*Contributed by [Daniel R. Dugan](https://github.com/Tvlistings)*


#### The Cloud

The cloud is simply another word for the internet. When backing up your files (such as music, pictures, and movies) on "the cloud" you are backing them up on servers that may potentially be far away from where you are. In short, your personal computer is considered "on the ground" while the remote storage servers located who-knows-where are "in the clouds."

*Contributed by [Matt Davis](http://github.com/chewieee)*


#### Cookies

A text file stored by the browser which is sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Mainly used to identify users and possibly prepare customized web pages for them.

Session (or transient) cookies are stored in temporary memory and erased when browser is closed, they do not collect info on user. Instead, they store information in the form of a session identification that does not personally identify the user. Persistent (or permanent) cookie are stored on hard drive until it expires at expiration date or until user deletes it. They are used to collect identifying info about the user such as surfing behavior or user prefs for a site.

*Contributed by [Yoshio Varney](https://github.com/yoshi415)


#### 404 Error

The frustrating page a user receives when the specific page he or she was hoping to access doesn't exist. Can be made less frustrating if it is accompanied by a clever joke, or a picture of a kitten.

*Contributed by [Malcolm Reddoch](http://github.com/mreddoch)*

Nasty error when a page is not found when requested that the hosting domain alerts the user/requester with.

*Contributed by [Dondi Fusco](https://github.com/dondi2112)*


#### SEO

How your customers find you online matters to an entrepreneur and/or a line of business process owner. Your customers often are customers of your competitors. SEO (search engine optimization) is the process of producing content that is:
1. Interesting enough to your customers that they find it organically and choose it over competitive products.
2. Interesting enough to the search engine provider to bump it up to the first page instead of competitive products.
3. Tricky enough to pretend to be one of the first two by gaming the search algorithm.

*Contributed by [Daniel R. Dugan](https://github.com/Tvlistings)*

SEO are  a group of best practices to improve your site not only for search engines but also for users. The idea is to make the content of you site as clear and targeted as possible for humans and bots to understand the value of the information. 
The main parts to think when making an SEO strategy are: keyword planning, website structure, backlinks and of course, content.

### Design


#### WYSIWYG

"What you see is what you get". Often a GUI interface where the changes you make in your editor are nearly identical (in theory) to the changes you will see on your page. 

*Contributed by [Nick Schwaderer](http://github.com/Schwad)*


#### Responsive Design

#### Grid System

Grid system is a system where we design the structure of our web page using rows and columns. 

*Contributed by [Bagus Aji Santoso](https://github.com/baguzzzaji)*

#### RGB

Short for red, green and blue, the three colors that make up a pixel. Each is an integer between 0 and 255, and a combination of three integers specifies a color to display.

*Contributed by [Dan Berger](https://github.com/dsberger)*


#### Hex

Hexadecimal: a base-16 numeral system. Digits are 0-9, a-f. Example: Hexadecimal(1c) == Decimal(28). In the context of color, Hexadecimal is used to numerically represent Red, Green, and Blue content, using three pairs of digits. This allows 256^3 (over 16 million) unique colors. Color example: #00ff00 is Green.

*Contributed by [Andur Carr](https://github.com/LaMarseillaise)*


#### Above the Fold

Content that is visible immediately when the page is loaded, without having to scroll. Good design will place important elements here so the site's visitors don't have to scroll to find content. A reference to olde-tymey newspaper formatting, where headlines would be placed prominently above the physical fold. 

*Contributed by [Dan Berger](https://github.com/dsberger) and [Nick Schwaderer](http://github.com/Schwad)*


#### GUI

Graphical User Interface. This is the modern interface that is used across a multitude of computers and devices and allows a user to interact with the electronic device through graphics and indicators. Basically if it isn't a text-based interface it's a GUI.  It is used as a generic term for a visual interface that the user can interact with.

*Contributed by [Jasen Carroll](https://github.com/jasenc)*
*Contributed by [Chris Fullinwider](https://github.com/Fully34)*


#### Front End / Back End

"Front End" refers to browser, and languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript that work within the browser. "Back End" refers to the server that hosts the web application, and frameworks like Rails that operate on those servers.

*Contributed by [Dan Berger](https://github.com/dsberger)*

#### CSS

"Cascading Style Sheets" find HTML tags and tell the browser how to display them.

*Contributed by [Ashton Christie](https://github.com/ashchristie)*

#### Javascript

The scripting language that runs in the browser. It allows interactivity with the user. It is also invading the back-end with the popularity of nodejs.


#### AJAX

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, and it is a programming concept used to enable web pages to exchange data with a server without the user having to refresh/reload the entire page.  It allows for web applications to send and receive data in the background.  A good example would be real-time updating of a twitter or facebook feed.

### The Basics

#### How do you create a new Git repository for a project locally?

To create a Git repository locally, you want to navigate to the root directory of your project and type 'git init'. This will initialize a local repository and load all of the necessary files git will need to track the files in that directory.

*Contributed by [Matt Davis](http://github.com/chewieee)*

#### How do you create it on Github?

By clicking on the plus symbol ('+') of your github user account and selecting NEW REPOSITORY
*Contributed by [Dondi Fusco](https://github.com/dondi2112)*

#### How do you commit changes?

By typing a git command, "git commit -m "Your message". It will move the files from staged to unmodified. Type "git status" prior to commit. You can see "Changes to be committed:". Type "git status" again after commit, you will see "nothing to commit, working directory clean".

The other way is typing a git commit -am "Your message", which will both stage and commit changes.

*Contributed by [Coco Matthey](https://github.com/cocoyeh)*

#### What is the difference between staging and committing changes?

Staging is moving files from Modified to Staged by issuing a git command, "git add your_file", "git add . ", or "git add -A". Committing is moving files from Staged to Unmodified.

*Contributed by [Coco Matthey](https://github.com/cocoyeh)*

### Remotes

#### What is the difference between committing your changes and pushing them to Github?

committing your changes places your changes in your local repository while pushing places your changes in the remote repository.

#### How do you merge branches back together?

In order to merge branches back together you should merge the master branch into your-branch

$git checkout your-branch
$git merge master

Resolve any conflicts that occur. Move back to your master branch and merge your-branch into the master branch.

$git checkout master
$git merge your-branch

You'll see output indicating any changes that were made

#### What is a "Merge Conflict" and when will it occur?

A merge conflict occurs during a merge when the same part of some file has changed in the two different branches. For example, let's say John and Jane are working on a project together. John creates a branch for a feature he is working on. While he is working on this branch, he modifies a file that Jane has also modified on the master branch. When John attempts to merge the master branch into his feature branch, he'll receive a message that the automatic merge failed and that the conflicts need to be fixed and the changes committed.
