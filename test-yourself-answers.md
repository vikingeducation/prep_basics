## Test Yourself: Answers

This is the file you'll use to add your answers to the [Test Yourself exercise](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/getting-comfortable-with-git-and-the-command-line). You will add them via pull request.

### Instructions

See the [Web Development Basics project](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/) for details.

Keep your answers under 3 paragraphs.  Replace the line that says *Your Explanation Here!* with your explanation and a link to your Github username.  See the example below.

The `.md` extension on this file means it's a markdown file.  You can just assume it's a text file with a bit of HTML-ish syntax.  If you'd like to read up more on markdown, which can be converted to HTML so you can add images or videos, check out the [documentation from Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  You shouldn't have any problem copying the styles other people have used.

#### Javascript

#### AJAX

Your uncle Leo has a website selling his famous meatballs (they're deliciously succulent).  On his site, he advertises how many balls he has left. Rather than having to refresh the whole page every time to see his most up-to-date ball count, AJAX allows the site to only refresh the ball count.  

Another example...

You load up gMail.  You want to see if you got new mail.  Rather than having to refresh the entire page and load up all the emails again (which takes some time), Google uses AJAX to load only the most recent emails you may have received.  This is much, much faster.

#### Why is Git useful for a developer?

*Your explanation here!*

#### Why is Git useful for a team of developers?

*Your explanation here!*

####  When you contribute to an open-source project, you generally fork the git repository and use the "clone" command to move it to your local machine.  However, when you are working on your own github repository, you use the "pull" command to bring the repository to your local machine.  Why not use the "clone" command in this case as well?

Clone is always used the very first time you bring the repo from Github and copy it onto your local machine.

Pull is used during all subsequent updates, when you're essentially just refreshing your local copy.
