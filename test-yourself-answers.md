# Test Yourself: Answers

This is the file you'll use to add your answers to the [Test Yourself exercise](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/getting-comfortable-with-git-and-the-command-line). You will add them via pull request.

### Instructions

See the [Web Development Basics project](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/) for details.

Keep your answers under 3 paragraphs.  Replace the line that says *Your Explanation Here!* with your explanation and a link to your Github username.  See the example below.

The `.md` extension on this file means it's a markdown file.  You can just assume it's a text file with a bit of HTML-ish syntax.  If you'd like to read up more on markdown, which can be converted to HTML so you can add images or videos, check out the [documentation from Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  You shouldn't have any problem copying the styles other people have used.

### Example Answer

#### Example Question

Questions I had trouble with:

>>>Remotes #3
How do you add your GitHub repo as the remote?

I am a little unsure of my answer above, but I believe it's "git push origin master"

*Contributed by [1m53ri0us](http://github.com/1m53ri0us)*

>>>Branching and Merging #8
How do you merge branches back together?

my only suggestion would be to have used a diagram similar to the one in the video where you described pulling from a remote repository, as it's fairly difficult to imagine this process 

though I feel I responded correctly with

1) from new branch - git merge master
2) resolve conflicts
3) from master branch - git merge "new branch name"
