## All About Web Developers

#### What does a Web Developer do?

A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in,
 the development of World Wide Web applications, or distributed network applications
that are run over HTTP from a web server to a web browser. *Contributed via Wikipedia*
So basically they are a programmer that plans, builds,
and maintains web applications and websites (which are both about the same today).

#### What's the difference between web developers and web designers?

Web designers are more focused on the visual aspecs of the application. They deal
more with layout and artistic aspects. For example they would try to design the
app so that it is appealing to the user, so they deal more with User Experience.
Although in today's world the line between developer and designer is more often blurred
especially in the startup culture however, not so heavily in the enterprise world.

#### What's the difference between front end, back end, and full stack developers?

Front-end developers focus more on the actual webpage itself or what the user sees
and how they intereact with the with application.
Back-end devlopers focus on the server side code or the stuff that runs the app
and handles all of the data that gets fed to the front-end.
The Front-end uses a lof of Javascript, HTML, and CSS while the Back with use languages
like Java, Python, or Ruby.
Full stack developers are those who are able to transverse over from Front-end to Back or vice versus.
Though they may tend to stick with one more than the other they still have the ability and skills
to handle both ends.


#### What's the difference between static and dynamic web pages?

Dynamic web pages are able to change and be manipulated by the user. While
static pages are just that: static. They do not change no matter what the
user does. They are typically just data there and provide little to no user
interaction.

#### What's the best way to get help when you get stuck?

GOOGLE!!!
Reasearch the topic, and ask questions. StackExchange is your friend.

#### Where are the closest developer communities to you?

Birmingham, AL. There is a pretty decent developer community here. WWCode, Meetups, CodeForBirmingham (an local branch of CodeForAmerica), etc.

#### What online developer communities can you join?

There are so many that it is would be difficult to name them all. It's best to start with github,
and then there is reddit (r/programming). Then check out Meetups and see if there
is anything local in your area.

#### Why is it better to use a developer-friendly text editor like Sublime Text than something oriented more towards word-processing like Microsoft Word?

The text editors are made specifically for programming while Word was made for
writing out documents, stories, and papers. The text editors have the ability
to be tailored to your preferences and can usually recognize all the different
languages you may use.

#### What are the top 3 characteristics of great web developers?

Persistence - You will come across some difficult times. You will get stuck. The key is to
just keep on trucking. You will eventually figure it out, either on your own or
from help. Not giving up is key.
Curiousity/Want to learn - There are always things changing in the world of programming;
new Languages coming out, new tools, new ways of doing things. This means that you
have to want to learn all the time. And not be afraid to learn either.
Ability to solve problems - Much like puzzles programming comes down to putting the pieces together
correctly. You have to put the pieces together in the correct order to make it work. Not only
that but you are creating the pieces as you go so you have to figure out what
the pieces are before hand.


#### What do companies look for in a junior web developer?

They are looking for developers who have done more than just school work. They want
people who have shown that they have a willingness and eagerness to learn.

#### What is the hiring process like for a developer?

To apply for a job, you'll have to submit a resume, cover letter
You will want to include links to any portfolio projects, and your Github page.
If they like you, you wil go through an interview process which can include a phone
interview, a technical interview (where test you knowledge of technical aspects to programming)
*Anything you put that you know on your resume is free game here!!!*
and likely an in person interview. You may also get asked to code for them.

## How the Web Works


#### What is the internet?

The internet is a global communication tool that is available via computers or other
electronic devices.


#### How is information broken down and sent?

It is broken down into packets and sent through random different ways to get to their destination.

#### What are packets?

Packets are bits of data that are parts of a whole that are sent from one computer or server to another.
An image, for example, is requested by a client. The host then serves it up by breaking it down into small pieces
called packets. These are then sent out with an instruction manual of sorts as to how to piece it all back together.

#### What is a "client"?

The client is a device or program that requests information by way of use of a server. A good example of this
would be the internet itself. When a user opens up a chosen browser, that browser
becomes the client.

#### What is a "server"?

A device or program that works with the client to fulfill requests from the client. It
communicates with the client to provide requested data to the user.


#### What is HTTP and how does an HTTP request work?

HTTP or "Hypertext Transfer Protocol" is the standard protocol for transfering
documents over the internet.
It works when the user enters a URL, the browser then creates a HTTP request so that
all the different servers can "talk" to one another.

#### What are DNS servers?

TheDNS ( Domain Name Service ) is a distributed database which keeps track of
 computer's names and their corresponding IP addresses on the Internet.


#### What is HTML and how is it used?

HTML or Hypertext markup language is a language of tags used to define the structure and
content of Web pages, such as headings, lists, paragraphs, line breaks, images,
etc.


#### What is CSS and how is it used?

CSS or Cascading Stylesheets is a language that describes the look and style of the elements
defined in an HTML document, such as fonts, colors, spacing, transparency, alignment,
and other design aspects of a page.
Basically, it is what make the HTML look pretty.


#### What is your browser's Web Inspector (aka Developer Tools) and how can you use it to poke around in a page's HTML?

Developer Tools will show you the actual HTML and CSS that generated content on the page.
By hovering over items, you can see how they were defined in HTML,
how they were styled in CSS, and any other relevant attributes.
You can also see any code that went into make the
application dynamic such as any Javascript that may have been used or libraries
utilized. You can open up the Developer Tools by right-clicking in the browser and selecting "Inspect Element".

The Web Inspector is a tool that allows you to view a web page’s source, the DOM hierarchy, debug Javascript, and more.


#### What happens behind the scenes after you click "search" on google.com?

A single click rings out on a dark night...
Picoseconds later (a lot of them) later the input is received by a usb or other peripheral device port
Nanoseconds later (a pile of them)  a short string of integers is sent and interpreted by the CPU of device used as a "click".
Milliseconds later (a group of them) a command is sent to open up an http handshake
Microseconds late (a few of them) the handshake is confirmed and search query data is exchanged
Centiseconds later (a handful of them) the data is processed and the return data is exchanged
Decaseconds later (two point five of them, in this case) your search is returned to your screen.

"About 98,600,000 results (0.25 seconds) https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=divisions+of+a+second”

There was a great reddit post on this somewhere that I filed away mentally. I will return it (in far more than .25 seconds) when I find it.

## The Command Line

#### What is the command line?

A terminal/shell that one opens and types in commands for various tasks (moving between directories, opening, editing files, removing files, changing settings and permissions, ,etc)
*Contributed by [Michelle Ho](http://github.com/michelleyho)*

#### How do you open it on your computer?

Type `cmd` under Start > Run on Windows, or `Command + Space`, type `terminal` on OSX, then hit `Enter`.

*Contributed by [Aaron Dressler](http://github.com/aarondressler)*

#### What is Bash?

"Abbreviation for Bourne-Again SHell, the command-line shell for GNU/Linux."
*Contributed by [Michael Alexander](http://github.com/betweenparentheses)*

#### How can you navigate into a particular file directory?

`$ cd <directoryName>`

`$ rm -rf <directoryName>`
*Contributed by [Michelle Ho](http://github.com/michelleyho)*

#### How can you rename a directory or file?

`$ mv <oldFileName> <newFileName>`
*Contributed by [Michelle Ho](http://github.com/michelleyho)*

#### Why are file permissions important?

prevent unwanted access and/or modification of files. Permissions often are for read, write, execute?

#### How do you view hidden files in a directory?

`$ ls -a`
*Contributed by [Michelle Ho](http://github.com/michelleyho)*

#### How do you find information about a particular command?

`$ man <cmd>`
*Contributed by [Michelle Ho](http://github.com/michelleyho)*

#### What is a "Superuser" and how do you execute commands as this user?

The "Superuser" is a user of a computer system with special privileges needed to administer and maintain the system. Superuser commands can be executed using 'sudo' in the command line, which stands for Superuser do.

'sudo' allows a user to run programs with the security privileges of another user, often the superuser or root user.

#### What is Vim?

Text editor that often causes debates with emacs lovers.
*Contributed by [Michelle Ho](http://github.com/michelleyho)*

Vim is an improved version of the vi editor that is included in most UNIX systems. Highly configurable it was built to enable efficient text editing which makes it quite useful for programming. Some even consider it an entire IDE.
*Contributed by [René Maya](https://github.com/viejOMs)*

#### How do you quit Vim if you get stuck in it?
`:q`

`:q!` (to overwrite and not save any changes)

#### What is the `.bash_profile` file and what is it used for?

The bash '.bash_profile' file is a startup file for the bash shell and is used for many things such as declaring the $PATH variable for login shells.
*Contributed by [Jason Barkley](https://github.com/jbarkl3y)*

#### What is the `$PATH` variable?

The $PATH variable is an environmental variable in the GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems that tells _shell_ which directories to search for *executable files* in response to commands issued by a user.

$PATH dictates the locations within a file tree that contains commands executable within a command line setting

*Contributed by [Jason Barkley](https://github.com/jbarkl3y)*
*Contributed by [Dakota Maulding](http://github.com/dakota2mu)*


#### Why might you need to add onto your `$PATH` variable?

You might need to add onto your $PATH variable so an application can be found and run in the command line.
*Contributed by [Richard Peterson](https://github.com/webbuyrich)*

#### What are alias commands?

Alias commands are shortcuts that can be set up for use with the command line. These are often set for convenience so things such as long scripts that are often repeated don't need to be fully typed out.

For instance, when using Sublime Text, one may not want to always manually locate files and open them using the application. Instead, an alias can be set such as 'subl' which can be used in the command line preceding the filename. This opens the file in sublime text, voila!

i.e. 'subl text.txt'

## Terms to Know

Define the following:

### The Web


#### URL( Uniform Resource Locator)

Address that one types in to reach a particular webpage.  Human readable address that eventually gets mapped through DNS into actual IP addresses.
*Contributed by [Michelle Ho](http://github.com/michelleyho)*


#### Domain
The part of the URL which specifies the location of the web server who is going to respond to your request.
*Contributed by [Richard Peterson](https://github.com/webbuyrich)*


#### IP Address

IP addresses are the absolute address of a website. Four number ranging from 0 to 255 and separated by commas, these are unique but difficult to remember for the everday user - hence the creation of URLs and the DNS.

*Contributed by [Malcolm Reddoch](http://github.com/mreddoch)*

A specific and unique numeric signifier of a networked entity; can be an appliance, computer, phone, etc.

*Contributed by [Dondi Fusco](https://github.com/dondi2112)*


#### DNS

The Domain Name System, or DNS, is the phone book of the Internet. It takes human-readable URLs and translates them to IP addresses so that packets know exactly where to go.

*Contributed by [Malcolm Reddoch](http://github.com/mreddoch)*


#### HTTP

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the protocol or standard used for transferring information around the web. It is the agreed upon way a browser (or client) and server "talk" through requests by the browser (or client) and responses by the server.

HyperText Transfer Protocol, defines how messages are formatted and transmitted and what actions web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands. For example a URL request to retrieve a web page from a server.

*Contributed by [Yoshio Varney](https://github.com/yoshi415)*


#### HTTPS

HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure is the secure version of HTTP, and is basically HTTP wrapped in another layer, TLS / SSL.

HTTPS is used to prevent "impostor" and "man-in-the-middle" attacks, among others.  Any submitted form data sent "over the wire" can be read very easily by a malicious user, so it is universally recommended that any sensitive information is transmitted via HTTPS.

*Contributed by [Aaron Dressler](http://github.com/aarondressler)*

#### POP & IMAP & SMTP

POP stands for Post Office Protocol, IMAP for Internet Messaging Access Protocol,and SMTP for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. These are set of protocols for handling email.


#### API

API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a set of programming instructions and standards for accessing a Web-based software application. Software companies typically release APIs to the public so that other software developers can design products that are powered by its service.

For example, Amazon.com released its API so that web developers could more easily access Amazon's product information. Using the Amazon API, a third-party website can post direct links to Amazon products with updated prices and product descriptions.

*Contributed by [Matt Davis](http://github.com/chewieee)*


#### Web Server

A program usually running on a remote computer that responds to requests from a browser.

*Contributed by [Unknown]*


#### Bugs

An error or defect in software or hardware that causes a program to malfunction.  Typically coding issue, but has extended to other fields.

For example: From DARPA newsletter 6.11.2009 "Code compiled successfully (completed tier 1.6 of Google/Haliburton world takeover project), but during deployment we found several bugs where sample populations were still able to think and feel independently.

*Contributed by [Daniel R. Dugan](https://github.com/Tvlistings)*


#### The Cloud

Cloud computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

*Contributed by [Aaron Dressler](http://github.com/aarondressler)*


#### Cookies

A text file stored by the browser which is sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Mainly used to identify users and possibly prepare customized web pages for them.

Session (or transient) cookies are stored in temporary memory and erased when browser is closed, they do not collect info on user. Instead, they store information in the form of a session identification that does not personally identify the user. Persistent (or permanent) cookie are stored on hard drive until it expires at expiration date or until user deletes it. They are used to collect identifying info about the user such as surfing behavior or user prefs for a site.

*Contributed by [Yoshio Varney](https://github.com/yoshi415)*


#### 404 Error

The frustrating page a user receives when the specific page he or she was hoping to access doesn't exist. Can be made less frustrating if it is accompanied by a clever joke, or a picture of a kitten.

*Contributed by [Malcolm Reddoch](http://github.com/mreddoch)*

Nasty error when a page is not found when requested that the hosting domain alerts the user/requester with.

*Contributed by [Dondi Fusco](https://github.com/dondi2112)*

The HTTP Status Code returned by a server indicating file not found.

*Contributed by [Aaron Dressler](http://github.com/aarondressler)*

#### SEO

How your customers find you online matters to an entrepreneur and/or a line of business process owner. Your customers often are customers of your competitors. SEO (search engine optimization) is the process of producing content that is:
1. Interesting enough to your customers that they find it organically and choose it over competitive products.
2. Interesting enough to the search engine provider to bump it up to the first page instead of competitive products.
3. Tricky enough to pretend to be one of the first two by gaming the search algorithm.

*Contributed by [Daniel R. Dugan](https://github.com/Tvlistings)*


### Design


#### WYSIWYG

"What you see is what you get". Often a GUI interface where the changes you make in your editor are nearly identical (in theory) to the changes you will see on your page.

*Contributed by [Nick Schwaderer](http://github.com/Schwad)*


#### Responsive Design

Ensuring that all possible devices and browsers are capable of properly displaying the intended content including: very easy to read and navigate; minimum need for panning and scrolling; and no need to resize.

*Contributed by [Jasen Carroll](https://github.com/jasenc)*
*Contributed by [Richard Peterson](https://github.com/webbuyrich)*


#### Grid System

The design structure for building a web page. A grid system streamlines the web development workflow by serving as a visual guide on which designers can organize graphic elements on a page in relation to other graphic elements on the page or even other parts of the same element or shape.

Grid systems speed up the design process while making the web page more visually appealing, but are not mandatory. However, working without a grid system will require sizing every column on the page without any sort of guide, that will then need to be applied to every page manually.

Even though grids are not necessary to design a web page, they make the process much easier and better looking visually.

#### RGB

Short for red, green and blue, the three colors that make up a pixel. Each is an integer between 0 and 255, and a combination of three integers specifies a color to display.

*Contributed by [Dan Berger](https://github.com/dsberger)*


#### Hex

Hexadecimal: a base-16 numeral system. Digits are 0-9, a-f. Example: Hexadecimal(1c) == Decimal(28). In the context of color, Hexadecimal is used to numerically represent Red, Green, and Blue content, using three pairs of digits. This allows 256^3 (over 16 million) unique colors. Color example: #00ff00 is Green.

*Contributed by [Andur Carr](https://github.com/LaMarseillaise)*


#### Above the Fold

Content that is visible immediately when the page is loaded, without having to scroll. Good design will place important elements here so the site's visitors don't have to scroll to find content. A reference to olde-tymey newspaper formatting, where headlines would be placed prominently above the physical fold.

*Contributed by [Dan Berger](https://github.com/dsberger) and [Nick Schwaderer](http://github.com/Schwad)*


#### GUI

Graphical User Interface. This is the modern interface that is used across a multitude of computers and devices and allows a user to interact with the electronic device through graphics and indicators. Basically if it isn't a text-based interface it's a GUI.  It is used as a generic term for a visual interface that the user can interact with.

*Contributed by [Chris Fullinwider](https://github.com/Fully34)*


#### Front End / Back End

"Front End" refers to browser, and languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript that work within the browser. "Back End" refers to the server that hosts the web application, and frameworks like Rails that operate on those servers.

*Contributed by [Dan Berger](https://github.com/dsberger)*

### Developer Tools and Code

#### HTML

The markup language which specifies the structure of all the pieces of a webpage.

*Contributed by [Ashton Christie](https://github.com/ashchristie)*

Hypertext markup language:  The coding read by web browsers that dictates the layout and style of coding within a web server.

*Contributed by [Dakota Maulding](http://github.com/dakota2mu)*


#### CSS

"Cascading Style Sheets" find HTML tags and tell the browser how to display them.

*Contributed by [Ashton Christie](https://github.com/ashchristie)*

#### Javascript

The scripting language that runs in the browser. It allows interactivity with the user. It is also invading the back-end with the popularity of nodejs.


#### AJAX

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, and it is a programming concept used to enable web pages to exchange data with a server without the user having to refresh/reload the entire page.  It allows for web applications to send and receive data in the background.  A good example would be real-time updating of a twitter or facebook feed.

#### Pseudo-Code

Basically shorthand for what you are planning to code. It's like sketching for programmers.


#### C

An older, light weight programming language that direcly inspired the development of many other languages.  It's one of the lowest forms of programming language, one step removed from machine language.


#### Ruby

Ruby is the most enjoyable language on earth. Easy and happy to code.

Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language. Created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto who has said that "The goal of Ruby is to make programmers happy".

*Contributed by [René Maya](https://github.com/viejOMs)*


#### Ruby Gems

Ruby Gems are Ruby programs and libraries in a self-contained format called a "gem" packaged by RubyGems package manager, a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems and a server for distributing them.

Part of the Ruby programming language, RubyGems is a package manager that makes it easy to download, install and run ruby programs and libraries (“gem”) and it’s files through a simple terminal command.

Essentially, a gem consists of two things: code and a gemspec (specifications for that gem) which is then used by rubygems to handle the management of the code.

Most gems are open source, and used in most applications. The majority of gems provide command line utilities that can automate tasks and speed up your work.

#### Frameworks

A framework is a platform where common code with generic functionality is ready to be used by developers along with possibility to write custom code.

*Contributed by [Olga](https://github.com/ayva)*



#### Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails is the amazing web framework for creating awesome web applications. If you want to live on edge, RoR is the right choice.


#### Command Line

*Contributed by [Ashton Christie](https://github.com/ashchristie)*

#### Version Control

It's like a time machine for jumping back and forth between specific time stamp for coding.

#### Git

One of the most popular open-source version control systems.

#### Open Source

Free licensed code.

*Contributed by [Olga](https://github.com/ayva)*

#### CMS

CMS stands for Content Management System, which is an application used to manage the content of a website.  The purpose of a CMS is to make updating a website's content easier, enabling administrators to make changes efficiently without the need for coding expertise.

*Contributed by [Adan Camacho](https://github.com/adancode)*

#### Database

A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can easily be accessed, managed, and updated. They cornerstone of every web application. This is where everything your users do is saved. Like a giant collection of giant spreadsheets that moves really fast.

*Contributed by [Mike Donnelly](https://github.com/SQLMD)*

#### SQL

Abbreviation of Structured Query Language, and pronounced either see-kwell or as separate letters. SQL is a standardized query language for requesting information from a database. The original version called SEQUEL (structured English query language) was designed by an IBM research center in 1974 and 1975. SQL was first introduced as a commercial database systemin 1979 by Oracle Corporation. Although there are different dialects of SQL, it is nevertheless the closest thing to a standard query language that currently exists.

*Contributed by [Mike Donnelly](https://github.com/SQLMD)*

#### XML

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a text-based format that allows for the structuring of electronic documents and is not limited to a set of labels. XML is used to describe data. The XML standard is a flexible way to create information formats and electronically share structured data via web services on the public Internet.

*Contributed by [Mike Donnelly](https://github.com/SQLMD)*

#### Schema

*Your explanation here!*

#### Script

Code that is interpreted from the actual program. The difference between the two
is that programs have an executable form while scripts are distinct from the
core code of the application.


## Installations


#### Why did you need to install Ruby?

As we might recall, back-end programming means coding on the server side. Since not all servers run the same programming languages we need to make sure we install in our computer the same language. When we install Ruby we are actually installing the Ruby interpreter which allows us to "run" our code locally so we can make sure that our Ruby programs will be executed correctly by our server.

*Contributed by [René Maya](https://github.com/viejOMs)*

#### Why didn't you need to install HTML, CSS and Javascript?

These are already native to the browsers and do not need a compiler or back end to interpret. They can also be authored in a simple text editor.
*Contributed by [Dondi Fusco](https://github.com/dondi2112)*

Most web browsers have the ability to decode all of the before mentioned languages.

*Contributed by [Dakota Maulding](http://github.com/dakota2mu)*


#### What is RVM and how will it be useful later?

RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager and is a command-line tool which allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems.

RVM is helpful because some gems, tools, and frameworks may only work with a particular version of Ruby. RVM lets you easily switch between different environments, based on needs, when developing.

#### What is XCode?

An integrated development environment (IDE) created by Apple for developing OS X and iOS software.

*Contributed by [Andur Carr](https://github.com/LaMarseillaise)*


## Git

#### What is Git?

Git is the most popular distributed version control system used for software development.  It is used to efficiently maintain and manage code for a project, is free and open source, has an emphasis on speed and data assurance, and allows for multiple workflows which can branch out or merge as needed.

*Contributed by [Adan Camacho](https://github.com/adancode)*

#### What does SCM stand for?

**S**ource **C**ode **M*anagement is generally achieved via software that provides coordination, communication and version control services to developers.
*Contributed by [Alex Clifford](https://github.com/akclifford)*


#### What is a VCS?

**V**ersion **C**ontrol **S**ystems (like Git) provide monitored and regulated access to a software repository.

*Contributed by [Alex Clifford](https://github.com/akclifford)*


#### Why is Git useful for a developer?

Git version control system is useful for a developer because it allows the developer the ability to access previous versions of their project, essentially being able to rewind time if they decide that a previous commit is better suited for their needs; be it a current implementation isn't working out, or to investigate changes to find where any problems may exist.

*Contributed by [Allan Beals-Gibson](http://github.com/afbeals)*


#### Why is Git useful for a team of developers?

Using Git allows a team of developers to independently work alongside one another, while having the ability to seamlessly implement those changes to the main project. It also helps situations where independent developers work may contradict each other, by showing changes and allowing the developers to choose which ones they would like to keep.

*Contributed by [Allan Beals-Gibson](http://github.com/afbeals)*



### The Basics

#### How do you create a new Git repository for a project locally?

To create a Git repository locally, you want to navigate to the root directory of your project and type 'git init'. This will initialize a local repository and load all of the necessary files git will need to track the files in that directory.

*Contributed by [Matt Davis](http://github.com/chewieee)*

#### How do you create it on Github?

By clicking on the plus symbol ('+') of your github user account and selecting NEW REPOSITORY
*Contributed by [Dondi Fusco](https://github.com/dondi2112)*

#### How do you commit changes?

By typing a git command, "git commit -m "Your message". It will move the files from staged to unmodified. Type "git status" prior to commit. You can see "Changes to be committed:". Type "git status" again after commit, you will see "nothing to commit, working directory clean".

The other way is typing a git commit -am "Your message", which will both stage and commit changes.

#### What is the difference between staging and committing changes?

Staging is moving files from Modified to Staged by issuing a git command, "git add your_file", "git add . ", or "git add -A". Committing is moving files from Staged to Unmodified.

### Remotes


#### What is the difference between committing your changes and pushing them to Github?

Committing your changes will only save them in your local repository. Pushing them to Github will save them to your remote repository.

#### What is the difference between a "remote" and your local repo?

A remote repo allows you to either pull upstream changes from the master repo, or publish (push) your local commits. A local repo is the enviroment where we can make local changes and is typically the one on our computer.

### Branching and Merging

#### What is a "Merge"?

A merge is when you take the changes you've made on one branch, and bring them into another branch to update it with the new changes.

#### What is a "Pull Request"?

A pull request is when you contribute to someones else's project, and you let them know that you have made changes that they can look over and possibly implement into their project.

#### What is "Forking" a repo?

Making a copy of another master repo into your own github account so as to not disturb the master in order to do work on it, make changes and/or corrections and later submit for a pull request

#### What is "Cloning" a repo?

Making an identical copy of a Git repo on your local server is "cloning" the repo. This is different from forking, where a copy of a repo is made in Git itself.

#### What is "Branching"?

In Git, branching is a way of duplicating your project so two different versions can be modified in tandem. The changes can then be merged back into the master branch.

Branching is when the developer creates a separate version of their local repository (master branch), allowing changes to be made to that new branch, that won't affect their master until the developer wishes to merge the changes.

#### Why would you use a branch?

Using a new branch allows the developer to make experimental changes to their project while having the ability to either discard those changes later, or merge them into their main project. It also allows teams to work off the master branch simultaneously and merge them all later.

*Contributed by [Allan Beals-Gibson](http://github.com/afbeals)*


#### How do you create a new branch?

Create a new branch by typing:

```
git checkout -b branch_name
```

*Contributed by [Allan Beals-Gibson](http://github.com/afbeals)*



#### Why would you use a branch?

Branching allows for different features to be developed without modifying the main document. The feature can then be merged into the main document if and when desired.

*Contributed by [Clayton Perszyk](https://github.com/clayton-perszyk)*


#### How do you create a new branch?

In your terminal type `git branch <name of branch>` to create a branch. Then type `git checkout <name of branch>` to start working on your new branch.

You can combine the two commands and just type `git checkout -b <name of branch>` and that will create and change into your new branch.

*Contributed by [Clayton Perszyk](https://github.com/clayton-perszyk)*


#### How do you merge branches back together?

In order to merge branches back together you should merge the master branch into your-branch

$git checkout your-branch
$git merge master

Resolve any conflicts that occur. Move back to your master branch and merge your-branch into the master branch.

$git checkout master
$git merge your-branch

You'll see output indicating any changes that were made

#### What is a "Merge Conflict" and when will it occur?

A merge conflict occurs during a merge when the same part of some file has changed in the two different branches. For example, let's say John and Jane are working on a project together. John creates a branch for a feature he is working on. While he is working on this branch, he modifies a file that Jane has also modified on the master branch. When John attempts to merge the master branch into his feature branch, he'll receive a message that the automatic merge failed and that the conflicts need to be fixed and the changes committed.

#### How do you resolve a "Merge Conflict"?

In order to solve a Merge Conflict, one needs to open the conflicting file in a text editor and find the conflicting lines of code. One can find the conflict by spotting the merge markers. To resolve the this, delete the line you want to get rid of and then delete the merge markers. After deleting the merge markers, you can save the file, add it to the stage, and finally commit it. Done.
