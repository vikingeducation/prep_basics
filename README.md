# [Become a Web Developer Online with the Viking Code School](http://vikingcodeschool.com)

This repo houses the student-sourced solutions to the "Test Yourself" questions in the [Web Development Basics](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/test-yourself) unit of the preparatory materials for the Viking Code School's web development program.  

These solutions can be found in the [`test-yourself-answers.md`](/test-yourself-answers.md) file, and that's the file you'll need to contribute to as part of the unit's [final project](http://vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/getting-comfortable-with-git-and-the-command-line).

Check out [http://vikingcodeschool.com](http://vikingcodeschool.com) to learn more about the program.
